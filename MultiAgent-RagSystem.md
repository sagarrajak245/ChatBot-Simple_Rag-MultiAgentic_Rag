### Core Concept
This system mimics how humans collaborate on research tasks - different specialists handle different aspects of document analysis and answer generation, then work together to produce the best possible response.

## System Overview

This system implements a sophisticated multi-agent Retrieval Augmented Generation (RAG) architecture using LangChain's built-in agents and LangGraph for orchestration. The system processes PDF documents and answers questions through a collaborative three-agent workflow.

## Architecture Components

### Core Technologies
- **LangChain**: Agent framework and RAG components
- **LangGraph**: Multi-agent orchestration and workflow management
- **FAISS**: Vector database for document storage and retrieval
- **HuggingFace Embeddings**: Text vectorization
- **ChatGroq**: Large Language Model (Llama-3.3-70b-versatile)
- **Streamlit**: User interface

### Agent Architecture
1. **Research Agent**: Document retrieval and analysis
2. **Answer Agent**: Initial response generation
3. **Critic Agent**: Answer refinement and quality improvement

## Detailed Data Flow

### Phase 1: Document Ingestion and Preprocessing

```
PDF Upload ‚Üí Temporary File Storage ‚Üí Document Loading ‚Üí Text Splitting ‚Üí Vectorization ‚Üí Vector Store Creation
```

#### Step-by-Step Process:

1. **File Upload**
   - User uploads PDF via Streamlit interface
   - File temporarily stored using `tempfile.NamedTemporaryFile`

2. **Document Loading**
   - `PyPDFLoader` extracts text content from PDF
   - Metadata preserved (source, page numbers)

3. **Text Chunking**
   - `RecursiveCharacterTextSplitter` breaks document into chunks
   - Configuration: 500 characters per chunk, 50 character overlap
   - Maintains context continuity between chunks

4. **Vectorization**
   - `HuggingFaceEmbeddings` (all-MiniLM-L6-v2) converts text to vectors
   - Each chunk becomes a high-dimensional vector representation

5. **Vector Store Creation**
   - FAISS indexes vectors for efficient similarity search
   - Enables semantic search capabilities

### Phase 2: Agent Initialization
